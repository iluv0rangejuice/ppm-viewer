Reflection
At the begining of this project, I wasn't too sure if I would run into the same problems as last time where I spend more time in tutoting and reqriting code over and over again. But when you gave a template of the code, I was able to put the pieces together and was able to do a majoriy of the code myself with minor errors. The first struggle was being able to view PPM-Viewer on Mac and see whether or not the code for NegateRed worked properly or not. But I think that's personally my fault because I kept breaking the code by copying and pasting files into new folders and being unorganized on where my code files goes. I was eventually able to figure out the solution but kept running into problems where I wouldn't know the error and have to ask for help. Beyond coding issues, there wasn't a moment where I was thinking, crap I don't have enough time for this. I felt the time for the project was great and very relaxing than one week for making a working code. But then again this project was a lot more bigger than the others. But I really enjoyed this project because it came to a full circle with previous ones, as well as add on more to it.
